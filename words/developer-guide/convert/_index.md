If you have originally created a document in a certain format, like DOCX, DOC, ODT or RTF, you may sometimes find it useful to convert the document to another format so you can take advantage of special features provided by it. For example, you may want to convert a Word document to PDF to protect your contents from any unauthorized modifications and make it easy to read and share simultaneously. Or, for instance, you may want to convert a PDF to DOCX to extract the original text.
