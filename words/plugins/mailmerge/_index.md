Most importantly, Mail Merge provides a unique cost-effective opportunity to boost marketing strategies through sharing the latest company's news and keeping continuous contact with the target audience.

### Mail Merge with Attachments

Free Mail Merge by Aspose allows not only to generate common emails with personalized content but also can be applied to generate customized attachments in DOCX, PDF, RTF and other formats (see the full list of [supported file formats](https://docs.aspose.cloud/words/getting-started/supported-file-formats/)) and send them together with emails. Currently, you can process the very first document in your attachments by selecting the "Process the first attachment" option in the dialog box.

## Privacy Policy and Terms of Service

Please read both [Privacy Policy](https://about.aspose.cloud/legal/privacy-policy) and [Terms of Service](https://about.aspose.cloud/legal/tos) agreements carefully before using our add-on. Among other information, these documents describe in detail how the add-on accesses, uses and stores user data.

By using the add-on, you acknowledge that you have read, understand and agree to be bound by the terms of the "Privacy Policy" and "Terms of Service" documents.

## Installation

To install the add-on, please do the following steps:

* Sign in to your Google Account
* Navigate to [Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/) online application
* Create a new spreadsheet
* Click "Add-ons", then click "Get add-ons"
* Type "Aspose Mail Merge" in the search bar, click on the found item
* Click "Install", then click "Continue"
* After the installation, click "Done".

## Usage

1. After having installed our add-on the first thing you have to do is fill your spreadsheet with data. This spreadsheet acts as a simple database and contains information to feed dynamically into emails and attachments. Each row in the spreadsheet represents data on a single customer except for the first row which contains the names of the fields. Add field names that you require in the first row, then fill in the `'A'` column with a list of your customers. To accelerate the process, you can simply import contacts from Google Contacts by clicking the "Import Contacts" menu item.

2. Prepare an email template with a built-in editor. It can be accessed under the "Add-ons/Aspose Mail Merge/Email Templates" menu option in Google Sheets. The letter template usually contains blocks of static content mixed with special Merge Fields. Merge fields are defined with curly brackets and act as placeholders for dynamic data substitution. Merge Fields are case-sensitive and should be carefully matched with the corresponding column names in the spreadsheet. For your convenience, we support two types of Merge Field template syntax:

* The first one is based on the use of double curly brackets ('mustache' syntax), i.e. `{{First_Name}}`, `{{Company}}`, `{{Address}}`. You can use the syntax of this type in the letter text, attachments, and even in the 'Subject' line of the email.

* The second option is to use the original Merge Field syntax proposed by Microsoft. Please note that you can use it in email attachments only. This syntax is more generic but requires a bit more effort to create. For details refer to the [article](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/insert-mail-merge-fields-9a1ab5e3-2d7a-420d-8d7e-7cc26f26acff) by Microsoft.

3. Once you've got the basics of your email template created, you can run Mail Merge as a separate program. It can be accessed under the "Add-ons/Aspose Mail Merge/Mail Merge" menu option in Google Sheets. For testing purposes, you can send yourself a test email with all Merge Fields set to column names.

4. Our add-on interacts with Aspose.Words Web Services to process Mail Merge templates and track the status of each email. In the process of execution, Gmail and Google Sheets services will communicate and exchange data with one another producing a sequence of automatically sent emails.
