## Important Changes and New Features

#### Android SDK

Fully reworked version of Aspose Cloud Android Java SDK has been released. Android Java Cloud SDK is a wrapper around REST API, allowing to process documents in Android Java quickly and easily, gaining all benefits of strong types and IDE highlights. The distribution is available at [Maven ](https://repository.aspose.cloud/webapp/#/artifacts/browse/tree/General/repo/com/aspose/aspose-words-cloud-android)and source code at [GitHub](https://github.com/aspose-words-cloud/aspose-words-cloud-java).

New SDK is fully supported and has the following advantages over the previous versions:

- SDK is fully in sync with the API, all missing methods are added
- Classes, methods, and properties have comments and are IDE-friendly
- Better security
- Usage of Request/Response classes to represent long lists of parameters. This allows for cleaner code and easier backward-compatibility going forward
  SDK is not backward compatible with the previous generation because of the last item. It should be straightforward to convert program code to using Request/Response objects, if you need any help on migration please ask at [Free Support Forums](https://forum.aspose.cloud/).
#### Added support of images with "relative path" in HTML to DOC Conversion
