## Important Changes and New Features
#### Inter-paragraph search
You can now use '\r' special symbols to search for text that spans across multiple paragraphs. For instance, "a\rB" will find text occurences where a paragraph is ended by "a" symbol and the next one starts with "B".
#### Adding comments to paragraphs and sections
Paragraphs and sections can now be used to specify a range of comments in Comments API.
